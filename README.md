# Iron Will - Wound Experience
The best way to get stronger is by struggle. Wound Experience adds experience points to any troop which survives getting wounded. With inspirations from Kenshi, this true "survival of the fittest" experience makes your troop battle hardened by just the simple fact of not dying after a possible fatal blow.

This decreases the grind for upgrading low tier troops and actually rewards the player for letting his weak troopos risk their lives by fighting in battle. It also indirectly buffs Medicine skill, by making it useful to upgrade troops. 

# Features 
  - Adds Athletics Experience to **any** Hero wounded in battle (20xp default)
  - Adds Generic Experience to **any** Troop wounded in battle (20xp default)
  - Only valid for **real** battles, so you canÂ´t cheese it by getting wounded many times in tournaments and arenas.

# To-do
  - Implementation of optional configuration menu with mildeww's ModLib
  - Configurable Experience value for Heroes
  - Configurable Experience value for Generic Troops
  - Toggleable linear escale Experience.
